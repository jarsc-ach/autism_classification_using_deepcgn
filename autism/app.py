        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term "spectrum" in ASD refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.
    """)
    
    st.subheader("Symptoms")
    st.write("""
        Some children show signs of ASD in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name, or indifference to caregivers. Others may develop normally for the first few months or years of life but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years.

        Each child with ASD is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity ‚Äî from low functioning to high functioning.

        Some common signs include:
        - **Social communication and interaction**: 
            - Fails to respond to their name or appears not to hear you at times.
            - Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone.
            - Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression.
            - Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences.
            - Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items.
            - Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech.
            - Repeats words or phrases verbatim but doesn't understand how to use them.
            - Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions.
            - Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings.
            - Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest.
            - Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive, or disruptive.
            - Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures, or tone of voice.

        - **Patterns of behavior**:
            - Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning, or hand flapping.
            - Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging.
            - Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change.
            - Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff, or exaggerated body language.
            - Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object.
            - Is unusually sensitive to light, sound, or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature.
            - Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play.
            - Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus.
            - Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods or refusing foods with a certain texture.
    """)
    
    st.subheader("Causes")
    st.write("""
        The exact causes of ASD are not known, but both genetics and environment may play a role:
        - **Genetics**: Several different genes appear to be involved in ASD. For some children, ASD can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of ASD. Still, other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
        - **Environmental factors**: Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications, or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering ASD.
    """)
    
    st.subheader("Risk Factors")
    st.write("""
        Factors that increase the risk of ASD may include:
        - **Your child's sex**: Boys are about four times more likely to develop ASD than girls are.
        - **Family history**: Families who have one child with ASD have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with ASD to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.
        - **Other disorders**: Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of ASD or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability, and loss of purposeful hand use.
        - **Extremely preterm babies**: Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of ASD.
        - **Parents' ages**: There may be a connection between children born to older parents and ASD, but more research is necessary to establish this link.

        Problems with social interactions, communication, and behavior can lead to:
