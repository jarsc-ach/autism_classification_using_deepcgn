# Autism Classification Using DeepCGN

This project focuses on classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a deep learning approach called **DeepCGN (Deep Convolutional Graph Network)**. The web interface is built with **Python** and **Streamlit** for interactive exploration and predictions.

## üß† Project Overview

- Utilizes DeepCGN for structured data classification
- Streamlit-based UI for ease of use
- Modular code structure for preprocessing, training, and deployment
- Includes support for large model and data files via Git LFS

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autism-classification-using-deepcgn.git
    cd autism-classification-using-deepcgn
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the app locally:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Large Files

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some large files (e.g., datasets, model checkpoints) are managed via Git LFS. During the latest push, an issue occurred:
